## Program Description
The program is made to demonstrate how two progresses could communicate through a message queue. This was achieved by creating a master, receiver, and sender process. The master process takes in an integer argument that determines the number senders and corresponding receivers to make. The master process then creates a message queue and forks the sender process while passing the queue ID in as an argument. This is also done for a receiving process. The sender process sends a statement to the console about its initialization. It then prompts the user to type a message that it will send over to the receiver. Once the message is sent the receiver declares its initialization and displays the message in the queue. The receiver then sends a receipt message containing its process ID so the sender knows the message was received. The receiver terminates. Then the sender states the confirmation message in the console before terminating. This procedure would repeat until reaching the number of times equal to the integer used when starting the program with “./master <integer>”. Then the master program will both delete the message queue and state that all processes have been terminated. After all of this is completed, the process will proceed to terminate. This demonstrates that two processes can share information using a queue system during concurrent operations and maintaining their state.
