## Program Description
The purpose of this lab is to create a memory segment with multiple processes writing to that segment. To simulate this, I created a master, slave, and myShm header file. The master, after checking all proper arguments were included, forks a slave process 𝑛𝑛 times. The slave process then initializes the shared memory segment equal to the one initialized in master. Then, the process converts the message into an integer array and integer index specified by the header file. The slave inserts its number in the specified index of the response array and converts the array back into a string. The string is then sent back into the segment where the next slave will update the message with its number or return the message segment to the master. After the slave processes are complete, the master states this in the console and returns the message content after all updates from the slaves. The master then proceeds to terminate. The header file was used to make sure the format of the message was the same regardless of what slave or potential additional processes use the memory segment. This demonstrates how a parent process could communicate with child processes using a memory segment rather than a memory queue or argument variable.
